# Sports Scoring App v3

### A full-stack app for showing Teams and Fixtures in a League

This is _version 3_.

I created _version 1_ using **Ruby** and **Sinatra** as my first project during week 5 (August 2019) of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

Upon completion of the course I have recreated the app using different languages and frameworks in order to further understand implementation of functionality and design choices.

I have created _version 3_ using **VueJS**. I began work on version 3 in December 2019.

Other versions:

- Version 1: [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on a Mac)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v1.0_ruby_sinatra)
- Version 2: [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on Windows)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v2.0_ruby_sinatra)
- Version 4: [Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & React Front-End | Node.js, Express & PostgreSQL Back-End](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v4.0_javascript_react)

## Brief

### MVP:

A user should be able toâ€¦

- Create, edit and delete Teams to the League
- Create, edit and delete Fixtures
- There should be a way to display all the Fixtures for a Team and all the Teams involved in a Fixture
- The app should display if a Fixture was won or lost

### Extensions:

- Create a League Table to see who is on top of the League
- Self-selected extension: Add "Play a Game" functionality, i.e. the user would select two Teams and the app would select a winner from these

## App Details

Status of the app and plans for further development as of 29th January 2020:

- _This version of the app is not currently functional. I plan to bring it to basic functionality so it can be compared with the further developed verson 2.0._

## My learning

- I have found it useful to recreate an app using **JavaScript** and **VueJS** to understand how the outcomes of the **Ruby**/**Sinatra** app design can be reached with a different language and framework.
- I have had some difficulties setting up the database and I am in the process of learning how to resolve this. The app currently shows the Home, Teams, Fixtures, League Table and About pages but with no data for the user to interact with.
