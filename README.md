# Sports Scoring App

### An app for showing teams and fixtures in a league

This is version 3.0.

I created version 1.0 using Ruby and Sinatra as my first project during week 5 of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

Upon completion of the course I have recreated the app using different languages and frameworks in order to further understand the implementation of functionality and design choices.

Version 3.0 has been created using JavaScript and React.

Other versions:
- Version 1.0: [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on a Mac)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v1.0_ruby_sinatra)
- Version 2.0: [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on Windows)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v2.0_ruby_sinatra)
- Version 4.0 (pending): Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & React

## Brief

### MVP:
A user should be able toâ€¦

- Create, edit and delete teams to the league
- Create, edit and delete games
- There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
- The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Extensions:
- Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
- Self-selected extension: Add "Play a Game" functionality, i.e. the user would select two teams and the app would select a winner from these
